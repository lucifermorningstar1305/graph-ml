# Repository Information
---

## What is this repo about?
This repo is a collection of my notes that I am preparing while going through these two books: 
- [Graph Machine Learning: Take graph data to the next level by applying machine learning techniques and algorithms](https://www.amazon.com.au/Graph-Machine-Learning-techniques-algorithms/dp/1800204493)
- [Hands on Graph Neural Networks](https://www.amazon.com.au/Hands-Graph-Neural-Networks-Python/dp/1804617520)

I somehow got interested in GraphML, idk why, but I am learning it and writing my notes while doing so. Hope you guys find it useful.

## How to setup the environment to run these notebook?
Oh that's easy, you just have to follow these steps:
- Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- After you clone the repo, just simply run: `poetry install --no-root`
- After the installation is complete; simply run: `poetry shell -q`

And voila! your environment is ready to be used.

## Whom should I contact if I have questions or issues with the repo?
Just raise an issue on this repo and I will respond to you as fast as I can. 

Cheers,
